  <!-- Folding Slots
    No folding slot configuration is necessary.  The client will
    automaticlaly choose a good configuration for you.  However, here
    are some examples:
  
      <slot id="0" type="CPU"/>

    or
    
      <slot id="0" type="CPU"/>
      <slot id="1" type="GPU"/>

    All slots in a configuration MUST have unique ids.

  <!-- Granting Remote FAHControl Access
    To grant remote access to FAHControl and the remote command server add
    the following:

      <allow>127.0.0.1 x.x.x.x</allow>
      <password>PASS</password>

    Where x.x.x.x is the IP address of the computer which should be granted
    remote access and PASS is you choose to further secure the connection.
  -->
  <allow>127.0.0.1 {{AllowedIP}}</allow>
  <password>{{RemoteControlPass}}</password>

  <!-- Granting Remote Web Access
    If you would like to grant remote Web access then you need these two
    configuration lines:

      <allow>127.0.0.1 x.x.x.x</allow>
      <web-allow>127.0.0.1 x.x.x.x</web-allow>

    Where x.x.x.x is the IP address of the computer which should be granted
    remote access.  You may also need to open port 7396 on your firewall.

    You can then access the Web interface remotely by going to this address:

      http://y.y.y.y:7396/

    Where y.y.y.y is the IP address of this computer.
